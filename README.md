The Odin Project new project called library


This is another "The Odin Project" project!
I've made a library and have various functions:

You can add all the books you want and depending on the quantity they will have a separation for more readable data.
You can delete the books you don't want anymore in the list with the delete button.
Also you can change the read status of every books you want!

I hope you can have fun with this new project.
